## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy this file** to `docs/changes/CHANGE-XXX.md` (get next ID from @change-manager)
2. **Update all XXX placeholders** with actual values
3. **Fill in frontmatter** with compliance data from ROAD item
4. **Add agent signatures** as they approve
5. **Update status** to `published` when complete
6. **Add to index** in `docs/changes/README.md`

## Validation Checklist

Before marking as `published`, ensure:
- [ ] All 7 agent signatures present
- [ ] ADR check: `status: pass`
- [ ] BDD check: `status: pass` (all scenarios passed)
- [ ] NFR checks: all `status: pass`
- [ ] Associated ROAD item: `status: complete`
- [ ] No placeholder text remaining (no "XXX", no empty strings)
- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter (test with `just validate-changes`)

## File Location

**MUST** be saved as: `docs/changes/CHANGE-XXX.md`

**NEVER** add changes directly to CHANGELOG.md - that's auto-generated from this index.
